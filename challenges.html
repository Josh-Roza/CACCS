    <h3>Challenges</h3>
    <p>-Teachers don't always tell you when you have assignments to do.</p>
    <pre>-I learned this the hard way.</pre>
    <p>-I had trouble staying on top of all my assignments.</p>
    <pre>-Things can stack up on you in college, make sure you keep a calendar.</pre>
    <p>-Some classes base their grade off of 4 or fewer tests. That can create a lot of pressure.</p>
    <pre>-Make sure you find and prepare for those tests, I learned that from experience.</pre>
    <p>-It has been difficult to find an internship. Companies don't often hire freshmen.</p>
    <pre>
-I will get some of my coding projects on the resume so I can demonstrate my coding prowess.
 Also, I will stay persistent and keep applying on Intern NE. Intern Nebraska is a program we
 learned about in class. It gives companies grant money if they take interns.
